## üõ†Ô∏è Installation

To run this program, you have two main options for installation: using a pre-configured script to set up the environment locally or using Docker.

### üêç Local Installation üêç

1. **Install Prerequisites**:
   - Ensure you have the following installed on your system:
     - **GNOME**: Required for GUI-based components.
     - **npm**: Node package manager for managing JavaScript dependencies.
     - **Python**: Ensure you have Python installed (preferably Python 3.x).

2. **Set Up a Virtual Environment (Recommended)**:
   - Create a virtual environment to manage Python dependencies and avoid conflicts:
     ```bash
     python -m venv venv
     ```
   - Activate the virtual environment:
     - On Windows:
       ```bash
       venv\Scripts\activate
       ```
     - On macOS/Linux:
       ```bash
       source venv/bin/activate
       ```

3. **Run the Setup Script (First-Time Installation)**:
   - If this is your first time setting up the environment, run the `setup.sh` script to install all necessary dependencies:
     ```bash
     ./setup.sh
     ```
   - This script will:
     - Install Python packages from `requirements.txt`.
     - Install JavaScript dependencies using npm.

4. **Start the Application**:
   - After the initial setup, use the `start.sh` script to launch the application:
     ```bash
     ./start.sh
     ```

5. **Verify the Installation**:
   - Ensure that the application is running correctly by checking the output or running provided tests.

### üê≥ Docker Installation üê≥ 

If you prefer to use Docker, follow these steps:

1. **Build the Docker Image**:
   - Use the provided Dockerfile to build the Docker image:
     ```bash
     docker build -t my_ml_app .
     ```

2. **Run the Docker Container**:
   - Start a container from the built image:
     ```bash
     docker run -it --rm my_ml_app
     ```

3. **Access the Application**:
   - Once the container is running, you can interact with the application as specified in the documentation or example scripts.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Additional Notes ‚ö†Ô∏è

- **Dependencies**: Ensure all required software (GNOME, npm, Python) is installed before running the setup scripts.
- **Custom Configuration**: For any additional configuration or environment variables, refer to the `README` or `INSTALL.md` file.

### Adversarial Robustness Toolkit (ART) üõ°Ô∏è

The Adversarial Robustness Toolkit (ART) is an open-source library designed to enhance the security of machine learning models against adversarial attacks. Developed by Trusted AI, ART provides a robust suite of tools for evaluating model vulnerability, implementing defense strategies, and improving adversarial robustness. It supports a wide range of attack methods and defensive techniques and is compatible with popular machine learning frameworks like TensorFlow, PyTorch, and scikit-learn.

#### üó°Ô∏è Categories of Attacks üó°Ô∏è

- **Evasion Attacks**:
  - **Description**: Evasion attacks aim to deceive the model during inference by creating manipulated inputs that cause classification errors. For example, a slightly altered image might be misclassified as a different object.
  - **Examples**: 
    - Gradient-based attacks (Fast Gradient Sign Method, Projected Gradient Descent)

- **Poisoning Attacks**:
  - **Description**: Poisoning attacks target the training data by injecting malicious data to degrade the model's performance or induce undesirable behaviors.
  - **Examples**:
    - Label flipping attacks
    - Data injection attacks

- **Inference Attacks**:
  - **Description**: Inference attacks attempt to extract sensitive information about the training data or the model itself. This can include reconstructing private data or revealing specific model characteristics.
  - **Examples**:
    - Model extraction attacks
    - Membership inference attacks

- **Backdoor Attacks**:
  - **Description**: Backdoor attacks introduce a "trojan horse" into the model, causing it to behave in a specific way when presented with a particular trigger while maintaining overall good performance.
  - **Examples**:
    - Trigger-based backdoor attacks with visible or invisible triggers

#### üõ°Ô∏è Categories of Defenses üõ°Ô∏è

- **Adversarial Training**:
  - **Description**: Adversarial training involves training the model with adversarially generated examples, thereby improving its robustness against similar attacks during inference.
  - **Examples**:
    - Integrating adversarial examples into the training set

- **Input Preprocessing**:
  - **Description**: Input preprocessing techniques aim to mitigate the effects of adversarial attacks by transforming or filtering inputs before they reach the model.
  - **Examples**:
    - Noise reduction
    - Image normalization
    - Input transformations

- **Robust Optimization**:
  - **Description**: Robust optimization involves modifying the training process to enhance the model's resilience to adversarial perturbations.
  - **Examples**:
    - Robust optimization techniques such as robustness-based regularization

- **Certified Defenses**:
  - **Description**: Certified defenses provide formal guarantees of the model's robustness against specific classes of adversarial attacks, offering a certain level of mathematical security.
  - **Examples**:
    - Robustness certification through techniques such as training with robustness constraints

- **Anomaly Detection**:
  - **Description**: Anomaly detection systems identify and manage inputs that deviate from normal model behavior, often used to detect and handle adversarial inputs.
  - **Examples**:
    - Anomaly detection algorithms based on statistical or machine learning methods
